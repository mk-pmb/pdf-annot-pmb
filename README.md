=============

<!--#echo json="package.json" key="description" -->
Tools (mostly bash + sed scripts) for adding annotations to PDF documents.
<!--/#echo -->


* ☑ Add your annotations to a PDF.
* ☑ Save annotations in a format suitable for revision control software (esp. git).
* ☑ Save annotations separate from the base document for less copyright problems.

Maybe someday I'll write docs. I hope you like to `findfont` `dup` `length` `dict` `begin` `exch` `bind` `def` `currentdict` `cvs` `moveto` `show` as much as I do. ;-)

* There's no GUI on the horizon.
* It's not intended to be used in production.
* It's not intended to be readable.
* It's not intended to be quality software. I started it as a dirty hack to get the job done, and then some demo scene wannabe hipster spirits started to haunt it.
